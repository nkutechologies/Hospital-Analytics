# Hospital Management System

The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and automate various administrative and operational processes in a healthcare facility. The system offers a range of features, starting with a Complete Patient Registration module that captures essential patient details, medical history, insurance information, and emergency contacts. Through this centralized repository, healthcare providers can access patient records quickly, leading to improved personalized care and efficient medical decision-making. The system also includes an Investigations Suggested to Patients feature, which recommends relevant tests based on initial diagnosis, enabling doctors to order tests seamlessly and reducing manual errors in the diagnostic process.
 
To facilitate effective patient care, the HMS incorporates a Lab Module responsible for managing all laboratory operations. This module enables lab technicians to receive test orders, schedule appointments, conduct tests, and record results electronically. Additionally, it ensures secure storage of test reports for easy retrieval and sharing with patients and medical staff. In parallel, the system integrates an HR Management System, providing a centralized platform for employee information management, attendance tracking, leave management, performance evaluations, and salary administration. This enhances workforce productivity, simplifies HR processes, and ensures compliance with labor regulations.
